# Sample_AI
-----------------------
The AI enemies are created with a Finite State Machine and it uses events. The entire project uses very little Update functions so it is very performant code-wise.

- You can move the blue player with WASD, rotate it with Q/ E and shoot with space.
- The enemy can be control by pressing the buttons on the screen. This first level is done this way so you can see that the enemy has all these functionalities and how they work.
(This level 1 is not completely done, but it can still show what I am capable of)

In the second level I will make it so that the enemy AI behaves automatically and you'll still be able to control the player, it'll be just like a third-person shooter game.
