# Sample_AI
-----------------------
The AI enemies are created with a Finite State Machine and it uses events. The entire project uses very little Update functions so it is very performant code-wise.

- The enemy AI behaves automatically and you control the player, it's just like a third-person shooter game.
### Controls : ###
- Mouse -OR- Right Thumbstick = to move cursor = rotates player
- W -OR- Up on Left Thumbstick = to move player towards cursor
- S -OR- Down on Left Thumbtsick = to move player away from cursor
- Left Mouse Button -OR- Right Trigger = to shoot

-----------------------------

This project was created with Unity 2020.3.13f1. Normally it should work from 2019 LTS up to 2021 LTS. If there are any problems with any of those version, please contact me:
